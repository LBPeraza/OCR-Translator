OCR TRANSLATOR
	competitive analysis



****  Good similar apps

Google Translate (iPhone/android)
	What I like:
		Lots of languages
		Great text recognition
		Text to speech after translation
	What I don't like:
		No real-time translation

Word Lens (iPhone/android)
	What I like:
		Real-time translation
	What I don't like:
		Less language support


****  Bad similar apps

CoolOCR (android)
	OCR is bad
	Translations aren't great




**** My app

I want to include real-time translation as in Word Lens
Ideally, my application would be a mobile app, but realistically that won't happen
I'd like a few more languages than Word Lens
	- Only languages with Latin alphabet for OCR purposes
I'll use Google Translate library for translation purposes
Potentially scrape Google Translate for text-to-speech - probably not
