	user study notes


User studies could have gone better
Most of my work was still in separate files
	-not all combined, had to show individual parts



Suggestions in order of priority

Make it clearer what the user can do
	>>> I implemented as clear instructions on top and
	    bottom of screen

Give option to change text in case OCR didn't work
	-OCR isn't perfect, especially OCR that was
	    written in a week
	>>> I implemented this as a tkSimpleDialog box

Auto Translate when text is seen
	-don't have to hit space

Auto brightness/contrast
	-instead of having sliders for brightness/contrast
