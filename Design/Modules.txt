OCR Translator
	module design document


modules:
	Animation - slightly modified from class notes to include mouse motion/release events
		
		OptionsMenu - extends animation to create a Tkinter GUI
			(within OCROptions.py)

	AsciiTranslator - utility class for translation
		(see goslate) - goslate returns a unicode string, which can't be displayed
		using opencv, so AsciiTranslator translates and converts to an ascii string

	BoxHandling - handles all operations on boxes found in video stream
		mainly used to replace text on signs

	compareImg - compares 2 black and white images - used in OCR

	constants - global constants used throughout the project

	extractBoxes - finds boxes in video stream which may be signs with text

	goslate - free module created by ZHUO Qiang - uses Google to translate strings

	OCR - reads text from image files

	OCROptions - (see Animation->Options Menu)

	OCRTranslator - main project file
		uses all above modules in tandem to create the user experience
