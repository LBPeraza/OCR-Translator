OCR Translator
	project proposal



My project will be a translator app which uses Optical Character Recognition(OCR)
and Google Translate to display translation results directly on an image which 
contains a foreign language. For example - if you are in a country where the people
speak a different language, and road signs and menus are all in that language, what
do you do? Potentially you could use my app to take a video of the sign, or the menu,
and the English (or your native language) translation of the text will appear right
where the original used to be on your screen.

Ideally this would be a mobile app, but for this course I'll keep it on the computer.

**** Modules
For image processing and OCR:
	opencv
For translation:
	goslate (Google translation library)
